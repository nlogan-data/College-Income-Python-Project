Data Source

Kaggle user Kensho Impact combined data from four sources: Opportunity Insights, Brookings Institution, College Scorecard, and Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The third and fourth datasets are sourced from the US federal government. Brookings Institution is a nonprofit public policy organization in D.C. with a ".edu" domain. Opportunity Insights is also a nonprofit based out of Harvard. All of these are trustworthy data sources.

Contents Overview

Each observation has 117 characteristics. These include basic information about the college—such as name, location, admission rate, and enrollment number—undergraduate demographic stats, parent income stats, SAT score stats, tuition rates, financial aid stats, student debt stats, degree completion demographics, graduate income stats, and major choice breakdown. See full documentation on column names here.

Limitations

The documentation on the data integration is not very robust. For all intents and purposes, it only tells us the meaning of the column names. Through this, we don't know which source each column came from. There also is not information on what year the data is from. It is safe to assume that it is recent, though, as Kensho Impact's dataset was published four months ago. I reached out to them on Kaggle, asking what year the data is sourced from.

Relevancy

While searching for a set of data, I aimed to take on a project that will evaluate equity in postsecondary education. What was most interesting was the relationship between a college's median parent income and several other variables.
